# PEMSF_Project
This repo includes the test and training data based on the PEM_SF UCI Machine learning dataset, and our current code to train a model on it.
The PEMS_train data file was too large to upload onto gitlab, even with it is compressed.
You can download a copy of the PEMS_train data file here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZEgm6lHap6ov93Dq_hI70Dd1bat7O759/view?usp=sharing
