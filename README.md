# PEMSF_Project
This repo includes the test and training data based on the PEM_SF UCI Machine learning dataset, and our current code to train a model on it.
The PEMS_train data file was too large to upload onto gitlab, even with it is compressed.
You can download a copy of the PEMS_train data file here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZEgm6lHap6ov93Dq_hI70Dd1bat7O759/view?usp=sharing
We created our model in the python file, project_group2.ipynb.
In order to run project_group2.ipynb, you will need to down load PEMS_train from the google doc link above and move it into the same directory as the the python file.
Next, you will have to download project_group2.ipynb, PEMS_trainlabels.txt, PEMS_test.txt, and PEMS_testlabels.txt as well.
Make sure those files are in the same directory as project_group2.ipynb.
Now you can run project_group2.ipynb.


# PEMSF_Project Prototype
In order to run our project prototype, you need to download the following files, Group2_Project_Prototype.ipynb, PEMS_test.txt, PEMS_trainlabels.txt, First_Day_Guess_label.txt, First_Day_Guess_test.txt, Second_Day_Guess_label.txt, Second_Day_Guess_test.txt, Third_Day_Guess_label.txt, and Third_Day_Guess_test.txt.
Make sure all of the files are in the same directory when you run the python file, Group2_Project_Prototype.ipynb.
